% (a) Solve the linear least squares problem:
%       [ 0.16 0.10;                  
%         0.17 0.11;   * [x_1 x_2]' ~= [0.26 0.28 3.31]'
%         2.02 1.29 ] 

A = [ 0.16 0.10; 
      0.17 0.11; 
      2.02 1.29 ];

b = [0.26 0.28 3.31]';

[Q,R] = qr(A);
w = Q'*b;
x_a = R \ w

%x_a =
%
%   1.00000
%   1.00000

% (b) Sovle the same least squares problem with:
%       b = [0.27 0.25 3.33]'

b = [0.27 0.25 3.33]';

%x_b =
%
%   7.0089
%  -8.3957


w = Q'*b;
x_b = R \ w

% (c) Explain
